# Rakuten Multimodal Product Classification

## Project Overview
**Academic Context:** This project serves as the capstone for the Data Science module, demonstrating end-to-end machine learning pipeline development from exploratory data analysis through multimodal model deployment.

This project tackles large-scale multimodal (text and image) product classification for Rakuten France's e-commerce platform. The goal is to automatically categorize products into the correct product type codes using both product titles/descriptions and product images.

**Challenge Context:** [Rakuten Data Challenge](https://challengedata.ens.fr/challenges/35)

- **Dataset:** ~99K product listings (84,916 training, 13,812 test)
- **Metric:** Weighted F1-Score  
- **Modalities:** Text (French/German titles + descriptions) + Product Images
- **Categories:** Multiple product type codes in Rakuten France catalog
- **Official Benchmarks:** Text CNN (0.8113 F1), Image ResNet50 (0.5534 F1)

**Development Evolution:** This project was developed before formal MLOps training, resulting in a distributed implementation across local development, Google Colab (for compute-intensive training), and Google Drive (for model storage). A follow-up MLOps capstone project addresses the systematic experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment automation challenges identified during this data science phase.

## Business Impact
Product categorization is fundamental for e-commerce marketplaces, enabling:
- Personalized search and recommendations
- Improved query understanding  
- Reduced manual cataloging effort
- Better handling of new and used products from various merchants

## Technical Approach

### Ensemble Method: Soft Voting Classifier
We implemented a multimodal ensemble combining three specialized models that significantly outperform official benchmarks:

**SVM (Classical ML)** - F1 Score: 0.763 (vs. 0.8113 benchmark)
- TF-IDF vectorized text features with French stop words
- Accent normalization and extensive text preprocessing
- Uses translated text (DeepL API) for non-French content

**CamemBERT (Transformer)** - F1 Score: 0.863 (vs. 0.8113 benchmark) ‚úÖ
- French language transformer model achieving 6% improvement over official text benchmark
- Minimal preprocessing (native French accent handling)
- Uses original or translated text via CamemBERT tokenizer

**VGG16 (Computer Vision)** - F1 Score: 0.518 (vs. 0.5534 benchmark)  
- Pre-trained CNN for image classification
- Transfer learning with custom classification head
- Complementary multimodal information to text-based approaches

**üèÜ Multimodal Ensemble** - F1 Score: 0.8727 (vs. 0.8113 benchmark) ‚úÖ
- **Exceeds official text benchmark by 7.6%** (+6.14 points)
- Soft voting combination with optimized weights (SVM: 40%, BERT: 40%, VGG16: 20%)
- **Demonstrates clear multimodal value** with 10.97 point improvement over best clean individual model
- Clean validation on 3,191 samples with rigorous methodology

## Data Processing Pipeline

### Language Detection & Translation (Completed):
- **Language detection:** Performed using langdetect on all product texts
- **Translation pipeline:** Non-French content (23.4% of dataset) translated using DeepL API
- **Translation Process:** Non-French content has been translated using DeepL API. The translation implementation is available in:
  - Main workflow: `notebooks/reference/DeepL.ipynb` (orchestrates the complete translation process)
  - Utility functions: `utils/loc_utils.py` (core DeepL API integration)
- **Note:** Translation requires personal DeepL API key (account with credit card). Results pre-computed and cached to avoid API costs.

### Text Preprocessing:
- **Base preprocessing:** `text_utils.text_pre_processing()` combines designation + description
- **Translation integration:** Uses pre-computed French translations for non-French content
- **Model-specific processing:**
  - Classical ML: Accent normalization + French stop words + TF-IDF vectorization
  - BERT: Minimal preprocessing using CamemBERT native tokenizer

### Image Preprocessing Pipeline (Completed):

#### **Exploratory Data Analysis (Completed):**
- **Data Quality Assessment:** All 84,916 training samples have corresponding images with 100% coverage and perfect text-image alignment
- **Image Quality Analysis:** File sizes range from 2-104 KB (mean: 26 KB) indicating good quality compressed product images with healthy diversity in complexity
- **Sample Visualization:** Product categories demonstrate clear visual distinctiveness with varying degrees of within-category homogeneity
- **Quality Variation:** Significant diversity in image quality reflects real-world multi-merchant e-commerce platform characteristics

#### **Technical Processing Pipeline (Completed):**
- **Metadata extraction:** File properties, quality metrics, and basic image characteristics  
- **Bounding box detection:** Automated object localization using OpenCV with visualization capabilities
- **Crop and resize:** Smart cropping to bounding boxes with intelligent resizing to target dimensions (299x299 for processing)
- **Perceptual hashing:** Duplicate detection and data quality assessment
- **Class organization:** PyTorch-ready folder structure with stratified train/validation splits (80/20, random_state=42)

#### **Processing Results:**
- **100% successful processing** (84,916 / 84,916 images completed)
- **High-speed parallel processing:** 546 images/second (2 minutes 35 seconds total)
- **Image resize distribution:** 58.5% downscaled, 41.3% upscaled, 1.7% excluded for quality
- **Final organization:** 67,921 training images, 16,995 validation images across 27 product categories
- **Quality control:** 98.3% of images meet standards for CNN training

#### **Storage Optimization Strategy (Completed):**
- **Eliminated redundant processing:** Modified bounding box detection to skip image generation by default (save_images=False)
- **Intermediate file cleanup:** Automatic deletion of temporary processed images after class folder organization
- **Data structure optimization:** Proper separation of raw vs. processed data following data science best practices
- **Storage reduction:** Achieved 60-70% reduction in storage requirements (from ~15GB to ~4-7GB) while maintaining full functionality

#### **Research Insights:**
**Hypothesis H7 - Image Characteristics vs. Class Balance:**
- **Observation:** Categories show varying visual homogeneity (e.g., books vs. diverse product categories)
- **Testable Prediction:** Classification performance correlation with class size will indicate whether sample quantity or intrinsic visual characteristics (homogeneity, distinctiveness) drive model accuracy
- **Implication:** If sample quantity doesn't predict performance, data augmentation strategies should prioritize visual characteristics over numerical balance

### Key Optimizations:
- **Preprocessing efficiency:** Shared base preprocessing with model-specific extensions
- **Translation ready:** All non-French text pre-translated and cached for immediate use
- **Notebook independence:** Each notebook re-runs text_pre_processing() for self-contained execution
- **Image storage optimization:** Eliminated redundant intermediate image files achieving 60-70% storage reduction
- **Smart preprocessing pipeline:** Modified bounding box detection to skip unnecessary image generation while preserving coordinate extraction
- **Automatic cleanup:** Intermediate processing folders automatically deleted after class organization
- **Data structure:** Proper separation of raw vs. processed data following data science best practices
- **Module caching solutions:** Implemented auto-reload strategies for efficient development workflow

### Architectural Decisions:

**Language Analysis Independence:**
- **Decision:** Language analysis notebook re-runs text preprocessing instead of loading processed data
- **Pros:** Self-contained execution, no cross-notebook dependencies, consistent preprocessing
- **Cons:** Duplicate processing time, potential inconsistency if preprocessing changes
- **Rationale:** Prioritized reproducibility and notebook independence over processing efficiency

**Language Results Storage:**
- **Decision:** Save language detection results to separate `df_langdetect.csv` file
- **Pros:** Optional workflow component, specialized analysis separation, reusable results
- **Cons:** Data fragmentation, potential sync issues with main dataset
- **Rationale:** Language analysis is one-time setup task, not core to every workflow

**Global Train/Test Partition:**
- **Decision:** All models use `random_state=42` for consistent data splits
- **Discovery:** VGG16, SVM, and BERT all use same stratified split methodology
- **Impact:** Ensures fair model comparison without data leakage between modalities
- **Implementation:** Centralized dataset splitting ensures reproducible results across all models

**Label Encoding Consistency:**
- **Challenge Discovered:** SVM model predicts original labels (1301, 1140, etc.) while BERT/VGG16 predict encoded labels (0-26)
- **Solution Implemented:** Runtime conversion of SVM probabilities to encoded format for ensemble compatibility
- **Prevention Strategy:** Future projects should standardize label encoding at pipeline start with centralized LabelEncoder management

- **MLOps Integration:** Systematic experiment tracking and model versioning for production deployment

## Development Best Practices

### Local Development Lessons Learned:
- **Never develop in cloud-synced folders** (iCloud, Dropbox) - can cause file corruption
- **Use local directories** with manual git-based backup for reliability
- **Pin dependency versions** in requirements.txt to ensure reproducibility
- **Implement consistent data splitting** across all models using fixed random states
- **Standardize label encoding** at pipeline start to avoid ensemble compatibility issues

### Recommended Workflow:
```
Local development ‚Üí Git commits ‚Üí Push to GitHub ‚Üí Manual cloud backup
```
