    """
    This Streamlit app, developed for **DataScientest**'s FEB25 BDS project, addresses **Rakuten**'s challenge of accurately categorizing marketplace listings through **multimodal machine learning** that combines text and image data.
    
    The technology creates competitive advantages by...
    * automating the **marketplace**'s product categorization, reducing operational costs and errors while simultaneously 
    * enhancing **user experience** and consumer product discovery as well as 
    * helping **vendors** reach their target customers more effectively.
    
    Use the sidebar to navigate through presentations of the project and team, the data's exploration, visualization and preprocessing as well as pages regarding modelling and prediction."""
